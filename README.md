# GimbalFeed
An internet of things prototype.
This application presents an updated list of Gimbal bluetooth low energy proximity beacons. The concept, initially concieved in a March 2015 Hackathon with Justin Porter, Ben Oberkfell, and Trung Tran, was that even a simple MVP could alleviate 2 problems: 1) a lack of communication between providers (a surgeon might not know who a patient's cardiologist is or if the anesthesiologist has come for a consult yet) and 2) it is challenging for a patient/family to keep track of all of their providers in a hospital setting. Each patient would have a tablet their hospital room with a list of care providers who have entered the room in reverse chronological order to give providers an at-a-glance update of the patient's care and who they should contact with questions.
We didn't get to a pilot, but I got a chance to play with iBeacons!
